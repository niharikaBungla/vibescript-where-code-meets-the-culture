This project aims to create and construct a one-of-a-kind Mini Programming Language (MPL) with a new-age touch using funny, Gen-Z-themed keywords to make programming fun for the younger generation. Instead of generic terms, our  language uses innovative, contextual words such as spill_the_tea (for print), no_cap (for if), and rizz_up (for functions),  making the coding process something new, exciting, and memorable. 

## feature:
To make the language functional, we acreated a Smart IDE consisting of a code editor, a Run button, error message display, and an output console. 
This provides a complete environment where users can easily write, test, and debug their programs.
The central objective is to connect intricate compiler ideasâ€”such as Lexical Analysis, Parsing, Semantic Analysis, and Intermediate Code Generation, with a fun and engaging interface that renders learning programming fun and accessible.
